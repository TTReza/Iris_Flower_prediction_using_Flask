# Iris_Flower_prediction_using_Flask

In this small flask project I tried to integrate the ML prediction model of Iris dataset. Used a simple classifier ( RandomForestClassifier) without any data cleaning or modifying, but used standard scaling.
The whole file contains:
1. model.py - a python file where the ml is deployed
2. model.pkl - generated pickle file for the flask deploy
3. app.py - simple flask api constructed

Hope as a beginner you will like it.
